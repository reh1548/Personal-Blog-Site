# Personal-Blog-Site
This is a Personal Blog Site I have created with Python Flask during my Python Boot Camp by Dr. Angela Yu.
Here I have implemented a CICD pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, Docker and Linux host.
Any changes made in GitHub repoitory will be captured by Jenkins automatically and then build, test and deploy the Blog application to the host.
