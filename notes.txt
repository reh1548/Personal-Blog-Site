In a Flask application that uses Flask-Login for user authentication, when you call `current_user`, you typically get an instance of your user model representing the currently logged-in user. You can access various attributes and properties of the user model through this object. The specific attributes and properties you can fetch depend on how your user model is defined.

Here are some common attributes and properties that you might access through `current_user`, assuming you have a user model with these fields:

1. `current_user.id`: This typically returns the user's unique identifier, such as their database ID.

2. `current_user.username`: If your user model has a "username" field, you can access the user's username.

3. `current_user.email`: If your user model has an "email" field, you can access the user's email address.

4. `current_user.name`: If your user model has a "name" or "full_name" field, you can access the user's full name.

5. `current_user.is_authenticated`: This is a property that returns `True` if the user is authenticated (logged in) and `False` if they are not.

6. `current_user.is_active`: This is a property that returns `True` if the user's account is active. You might use this to check if a user is banned or inactive.

7. `current_user.is_anonymous`: This is a property that returns `True` for anonymous users (users who are not logged in).

8. Any other fields or properties defined in your user model: Depending on your user model's definition, you can access any additional fields you've added, like profile information, roles, or any other user-specific data.

The specific attributes you can access through `current_user` depend on your user model's structure. It's important to customize your user model to include the fields and properties that are relevant to your application's requirements.
